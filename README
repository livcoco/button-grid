Button-grid: Programs and files for making a grid of buttons, that
when clicked send associated commands. - jiw - (C) Sept 2018 - Offered

The program 5boxgrid.py uses PyQt5 graphics to draw a grid of labeled
buttons, with a value associated to each button.  (Re installing
PyQt5, see http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html )

Button-grid layout is directed by specifications read from an XML
file.  See comments in the file grid2.xml for details of XML content.
5boxgrid.py supports use of macros in the XML text.  Macro syntax and
rules are described in comments in the module macroSubst.py.

While future program versions may use client-server code to send
button data, the current version of 5boxgrid.py (Sept 2018) just
prints a set of button data when a button is clicked.

Files 3boxgrid.py, grid1.xml, color-try.py, and style3buttonsEG.py are
demo or test programs.  The XML in grid1.xml is an obsolete form used
by 3boxgrid.py, a program that uses Gtk 3.0 graphics rather than Qt5
in an unsuccessful attempt at properly-colored buttons without using
CSS.  (5boxgrid.py uses CSS.)  color-try.py uses Qt5 calls in an
attempt to color randomly-placed buttons.  style3buttonsEG.py
successfully uses CSS with Qt5 to display a 3-button menu.
