Button-grid: Programs and files for making a grid of buttons, that
when clicked send associated commands. - jiw - (C) Sept 2018 - Offered

The program 5boxgrid.py uses PyQt5 graphics to draw a grid of labeled
buttons, with a value associated to each button.  (Re installing
PyQt5, see http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html )

The 5boxgrid.py program merely prints the button label, its row and
column numbers, and its associated value when a button is clicked.
Later versions will use client-server code.

Grid layout is directed by specifications read from an XML file.  See
comments in the file grid2.xml for details of XML content.
5boxgrid.py supports use of macros in the XML text.  Macro syntax and
rules are described in comments in the module macroSubst.py.
